# CallQAWorkflow
This workflow takes call audio recording form html page, transcribes it, evaluates based on a defined criterion, translates if a language other than English is needed, and then sends output to html page to be displayed. The main parts of final output contain call summary, strengths, opportunities, call rate and call score.
